think outloud when working on coding problems
PREP

ex:
Fizz Buzz 
Given a random number as an input to a function, return "FIZZ" if the number 
is even and "BUZZ" if the number is odd

Example Input: 1
Example Output: 'BUZZ'
Example Input: 1002
Example Output: 'FIZZ'

answer:
# write function of random number
def even_or_odd(num):
# determine if number is even by dividing by 2
  if num % 2 == 0:
# return fizz if true
    return 'fizz'
# if false return buzz
  else:
    return 'buzz'

print(even_or_odd(1002))

ipynb= interactive python notebook
open anaconda navigator
click launch on Jupyter Notebook
it will open a localhost

jupyter notebook is a nice inbetween from vscode and cli
in jynb you can run specific code instead of having to run all the code to get to one at the bottom
or middle
